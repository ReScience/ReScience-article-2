Dear Prof. Lenski,

We would like to bring to your attention the manuscript entitled

    Sustainable computational science: the ReScience initiative

and ask you to consider it for publication in PNAS.

The article documents the first two years of ReScience, an online
journal dedicated to publishing replication work in computational
science. The author list contains everybody who has actively
contributed to this venture, in the role of author, reviewer, or
editor.

ReScience aims to solve the problem of scientific models disappearing
from the scientific literature. More and more scientific models take
the form of complex algorithms, which are impossible to describe in
detail in a traditional journal article. The full model exists only in
the form of computer software, which is traditionally not published.
The peer-reviewed article contains only a summary of the method,
making it very difficult for reviewers and readers to understand
the method and the results obtained with its help.

Publishing the software is not a sufficient solution either. Much
research software is hard to understand and hard to use. Moreover,
it is very difficult to judge if it actually corresponds to the
published method summary.

The best technique we have today to validate computational methods is
an independent reimplementation by another team, based on the
published method summary. If this independently developed software
replicates the results of the original one, many mistakes commonly
made in computational science can be excluded. The trust in the
correctness of the results can be increased further by subjecting the
independent reimplementation to peer review.

ReScience makes two important contributions that traditional
scientific journals cannot offer. First, it provides a venue for
publishing replication work, which traditional journals exclude for
lack of novelty, and thereby provides an incentive for contributing to
scientific quality assurance. Second, it has a peer reviewing process
adapted to the specific needs of computational replication work,
borrowing from the techniques of both scientific peer review and
collaborative software development.

Considering the ever increasing importance of computational methods in
all scientific disciplines, we believe that our approach to
replication is of interest to a broad audience of researchers,
and therefore to the readership of PNAS. Moreover, we feel that
our initiative is fully in line with the National Academy's
recent efforts to improve reproducibility and replicability
in science.
